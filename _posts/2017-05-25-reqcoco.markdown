**ReqCoco** which stands for *Requirements Code Coverage* s a set of tools which helps to generate reports of code coverage.

The reports can generated in different ways (console, html, pdf, xlsx, ...)

Custom generators can be built by anyone in order to generate a standard input source. And then ReqCoCo can be used to generate the reports in the desired format/output.
